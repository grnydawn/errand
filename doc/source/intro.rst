errand makes use of programming tools that you are already familar with. For example, if you are familiar with CUDA programming, errand uses Nvidia CUDA compiler and manages data movements between GPU and CPU so that you can focus on computation in CUDA.

-------------
Installation
-------------

The easiest way to install errand is to use the pip python package manager. 

        >>> pip install errand

You can install errand from github code repository if you want to try the latest version.

        >>> git clone https://github.com/grnydawn/errand.git
        >>> cd errand
        >>> python setup.py install

Vector addition example in CUDA(Nvidia) or HIP(AMD)

Python code

::

		import numpy as np
		from errand import Errand

		N = 100

		a = np.ones(N)
		b = np.ones(N) * 2
		c = np.zeros(N)

		with Errand("order.ord") as erd:

			# call gofers
			gofers = erd.gofers(N)

			# build workshop with input and output where actual work is going to be done
			workshop = erd.workshop(a, b, "->", c)

			# let gofers do work
			gofers.run(workshop)

		assert c.sum() == a.sum() + b.sum()


Order code(order.ord)

::

		[signature: x, y -> z]

		[cuda, hip]

			int id = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x;
			if(id < x.size()) z.data[id] = x.data[id] + y.data[id];
