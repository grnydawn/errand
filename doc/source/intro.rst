**errand** makes use of conventional programming tools that you may be already familar with. For example, **errand** uses Nvidia CUDA compiler or AMD HIP compiler if needed. **errand** takes responsibilities of data movements between GPU and CPU so that you can focus on computation in CUDA or HIP.

Installation
-------------

The easiest way to install errand is to use the pip python package manager. 

        >>> pip install errand

You can install errand from github code repository if you want to try the latest version.

        >>> git clone https://github.com/grnydawn/errand.git
        >>> cd errand
        >>> python setup.py install


Vector addition example in CUDA(Nvidia) or HIP(AMD)
-------------------------------------------------------

To run the example, create two source files in a folder as shown below, and run the Python script as usual.
The example assumes that at least one of CUDA compiler (nvcc) or HIP compiler (hipcc) is usuable and 
GPU is available on your system.

::

	>>> python main.py


Python code (main.py)

::

	import numpy as np
	from errand import Errand

	N1 = 10
	N2 = 20

	a = np.ones((N1, N2))
	b = np.ones((N1, N2))
	c = np.zeros((N1, N2))

	with Errand("order.ord") as erd:

		# call N1 teams of N2 gofers 
		gofers = erd.gofers(N1, N2)

		# build workshop with input and output, where actual work takes place
		workshop = erd.workshop(a, b, "->", c)

		# let gofers do their work
		gofers.run(workshop)

		# do your work while gofers are doing their work

	# check the result when the errand is completed
	if np.array_equal(c, a+b):
		print("SUCCESS!")

	else:
		print("FAILURE!")


Order code (order.ord)

::

	# the input and output variables are renamed
	# from a, b, and c to x, y, and z

	[signature: x, y -> z]

	[cuda, hip]

		// N1 teams are interpreted to Cuca/Hip blocks
		// N2 gofers are interpreted to Cuca/Hip threads
		int row = blockIdx.x;
		int col = threadIdx.x;

		// the input and output variables keep the convinience of numpy
		z(row, col) = x(row, col) + y(row, col);
